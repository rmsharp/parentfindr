***Multiple Sires/Dams*** 

***Errors*** 

***Definitions***
Calls: the section of the report for trios, where given the current threholds and data the offspring resolved to one sire and one dam.
Type: The individual's role in the would-be trio.
ID: the individual's ID as used in the input files.
discrep: the number of discrepancies, where the dam could not match to a child allele, or where the sire could not match after evaluating the dam.
#concord: the number of concordant loci.
%concord: the number of concordant loci as a percentage of the loci that were recognizable in both parent and offspring.
missing/missing markers: the number of loci that had one or more unrecognizable allele values.
unused: the number of recognizable locus values in the individual that had a missing corresponding locus in the offspring.
total: discrep+concord+missing+unused, should equal the number of expected markers in the file.
